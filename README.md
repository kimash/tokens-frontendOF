## Tokens Game - Front-End UI

### Description

This web UI allows users to create a series of game rounds for a public policy tokens game. Each round has a series of yes/no questions. Each answer returns a different outcome with respect to the tokens affected. Some answers will add tokens, others will subtract them. For example:

* Should we build more schools?

- income tax: Yes: +5, No: -3 
- education level: Yes: +3, No: -4 
- public health: Yes: +2, No: -5 
- entrepreneurship: Yes: +3, No: -1 
- community art: Yes: -3, No: +4 
- immigration: Yes: 0, No: 0
